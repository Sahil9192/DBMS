The error you encountered is due to the fact that MySQL doesn't support the `DECLARE` statement outside of stored programs, such as stored procedures, functions, or triggers. If you want to declare variables and write PL/SQL-like code in MySQL, you need to encapsulate the code within a stored procedure.

Here's how you can rewrite your PL/SQL code block as a MySQL stored procedure:

### **1. Create the `Borrower` and `Fine` Tables**

Before creating the stored procedure, ensure you have the necessary tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Borrower (
    Roll_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Date_of_Issue DATE,
    Name_of_Book VARCHAR(100),
    Status CHAR(1)
);

CREATE TABLE Fine (
    Roll_no INT,
    Date DATE,
    Amt DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (Roll_no) REFERENCES Borrower(Roll_no)
);
```

### **2. Create the Stored Procedure**

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE ProcessBookReturn(IN p_roll_no INT, IN p_name_of_book VARCHAR(100))
BEGIN
    DECLARE v_issue_date DATE;
    DECLARE v_current_date DATE DEFAULT CURDATE();
    DECLARE v_days INT;
    DECLARE v_fine_amt DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0;

    -- Fetch the issue date from the Borrower table
    SELECT Date_of_Issue INTO v_issue_date
    FROM Borrower
    WHERE Roll_no = p_roll_no AND Name_of_Book = p_name_of_book;

    -- Calculate the number of days since the book was issued
    SET v_days = DATEDIFF(v_current_date, v_issue_date);

    -- Calculate fine based on the number of days
    IF v_days > 30 THEN
        SET v_fine_amt = (v_days - 30) * 50 + (30 * 5);
    ELSEIF v_days >= 15 THEN
        SET v_fine_amt = v_days * 5;
    END IF;

    -- Update the status of the book in the Borrower table
    UPDATE Borrower
    SET Status = 'R'
    WHERE Roll_no = p_roll_no AND Name_of_Book = p_name_of_book;

    -- If a fine is applicable, store the details in the Fine table
    IF v_fine_amt > 0 THEN
        INSERT INTO Fine (Roll_no, Date, Amt)
        VALUES (p_roll_no, v_current_date, v_fine_amt);
    END IF;

    SELECT 'Book return processed successfully.' AS message;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

### **3. Call the Stored Procedure**

After creating the stored procedure, you can call it to process a book return:

```sql
CALL ProcessBookReturn(101, 'The Great Gatsby');
```

### **Explanation:**

- **`DELIMITER $$` and `DELIMITER ;`:** These commands change the statement delimiter so that MySQL doesn't execute the stored procedure prematurely.
- **`CREATE PROCEDURE`:** Defines the stored procedure named `ProcessBookReturn`.
- **`IN p_roll_no INT, IN p_name_of_book VARCHAR(100)`:** Input parameters for the procedure.
- **`DECLARE`:** Used to declare local variables within the procedure.
- **`SELECT INTO`:** Retrieves data from the table and stores it in a variable.
- **`DATEDIFF`:** Calculates the difference in days between two dates.
- **`SET`:** Assigns values to variables.
- **`IF-ELSEIF`:** Control structure to calculate the fine.
- **`UPDATE`:** Changes the status of the book in the `Borrower` table.
- **`INSERT`:** Adds a record to the `Fine` table if a fine is applicable.

This approach allows you to implement the logic in MySQL while handling book returns and fine calculations.
